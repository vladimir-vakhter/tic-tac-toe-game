# tic-tac-toe game
A small interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.<br>

## Features
This game:
1. Lets you play tic-tac-toe.
2. Indicates when a player has won the game.
3. Indicates if opponents played in a draw.
4. Stores a game’s history as a game progresses.
5. Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## Access
The game is available on my [GitHub pages](https://vladimir-vakhter.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/).

## Technology
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Possible Further Improvements
There is a room for further improvements for this application. Below are some ideas:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. Style the game using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
